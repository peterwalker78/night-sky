//! The wisp: a flame-shaped sprite with a friendly face, resting on a tuft of
//! moss in its nook. It is the same wisp that lives in the Glimmerwood
//! browser; here it comes out at night to show someone the sky.
//!
//! This is the whole of it — its moods, its motion, its face and its moss —
//! drawn on a `Canvas` and so the same wherever Glimmerwood runs. What it
//! cannot know it is told: the frame's time, whether the platform wants
//! animation, and whether the chrome around it is dark.
//!
//! Its colours along the dose come from `core/data/wisp.toml`; its face,
//! motion and moss are set by the constants below. It asks to be redrawn
//! only as often as what it is doing needs, and a still wisp (reduced
//! motion) only when the dose moves.
