//! The small 2D vocabulary the wisp is drawn in.
//!
//! The wisp is written once against this trait and whatever draws it lends
//! it a surface: here, cairo. Nothing here is more than every 2D
//! library has had for thirty years — paths, fills, strokes, a clip, a
//! transform stack and two kinds of gradient.
//!
//! It is stateful, like the libraries behind it: set a paint, build a path,
//! then fill or stroke it. A path's points are taken in the transform in
//! force when they are added, so the usual trick of scaling, drawing a
//! circle and restoring gives an ellipse.
